Kraftvaerk.SimpleCodeEditor
===========================
This package is based on a simple JavaScript called "behave.js" from http://jakiestfu.github.io/Behave.js/ - It adds some simple code editor features to a textarea, which makes it possible to use tabs, activate line-numbers, change themes etc.

It can be usefull in cases where you want the editors to be able to insert some simple code like html, css or javascript using a text-array. This package makes it possible to get a better structure on the code.
